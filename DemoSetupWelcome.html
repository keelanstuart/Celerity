The controls are simple:
<br>
<ul>
<li><b>A, W, S, D</b> - Moves you around in the world</li>
<li><b>Q, Z</b> - Moves you up and down</li>
<li><b>MOUSE</b> - Looks around</li>
<li><b>MOUSEWHEEL</b> - Zooms in and out, allows orbiting</li>
<li><b>ESC</b> - Toggles your mouse active</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br>

Also, now included is C3Edit, the editor application. While not fully functional yet, prototypes are loaded and can be
instantiated by double-clicking them. No object selection or manipulation is finished, but the camera can be zoomed and rotated,
with the mouse wheel and by holding the shift key while moving the mouse, respectively.
