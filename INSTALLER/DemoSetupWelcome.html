This will install a tech demo for <b>Celerity</b><sup>tm</sup>, a game / graphics / simulation engine written by Keelan Stuart,

<br>
<p>
The controls are:
<br>
<ul>
<li><b>A, W, S, D</b> - Moves you around in the world</li>
<li><b>Q, Z</b> - Moves you up and down</li>
<li><b>C</b> - Toggles view mode; track, track position only, free camera</li>
<li><b>MOUSE</b> - Looks around</li>
<li><b>MOUSEWHEEL</b> - Zooms in and out, allows orbiting</li>
<li><b>ESC</b> - Toggles your mouse active</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br>

<p>
Also included is C3Edit, the editor application. While not fully functional yet, prototypes are loaded and can be
instantiated by double-clicking them. Object selection and manipulation is a work in progress, but functional.
<p>
The controls are:
<br>
<ul>
<li>Camera pan/tilt with the mouse is activated by holding down shift</li>
<li>Camera orbit distance is adjusted with the wheel</li>
<li><b>A, W, S, D</b> - Moves you around in the world</li>
<li><b>Q, Z</b> - Moves you up and down</li>
<li><b>C</b> - Centers on selected object(s)</li>
<li><b>`</b> - Toggles the active axes for the currently selected tool</li>
<li><b>1, 2, 3, 4, 5</b> - Activates a tool (Select, Move, Rotate, Uniscale, Scale)</li>
<li>Clicking an object will select it. Ctrl-Click will toggle selection (allows group selection)</li>
</ul>
Controls are cascading... so you can click and drag on an object, moving it around <i>while</i> hold C, so the world appears to move around
instead of the object itself... and you can orbit the camera around the object by holding shift. But you never have to let go of the mouse
button once you have started an action. Drag to the window edge and the cursor will wrap to the other side, allowing you to continuously move.
<br>
I think you'll like it.
