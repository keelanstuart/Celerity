Celerity stands out in the game engine ecosystem by functioning as both a 
complete engine and a modular framework. Whether you need a full-featured 
platform or just specific functionality, Celerity adapts to your application's 
needs. You can use the included C3App or C3Edit applications as starting 
points for custom software or as the foundation for script- and plug-in-based 
solutions. Either way, Celerity is designed with intuitive, extensible APIs 
covering graphics, audio, simulation components, multi-device input mapping, 
and embedded scripting via a JavaScript-like language.
